The graphs for all the experiments should be named according to the following scheme:
The data tree should also be stored in this format for ease of parsing.

<Platform>_<Benchmark>_<Linux>_<Buddy>_<Data>_<Corun>_<Utilization>.png

1. Platform
   Consists of two letters denoting the target platform. 
	TG	->	Tegra
